# ODZ-MAGs
Scripts for bioinformatics analysis associated with metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from ODZs

HMMprofiles: 
	A folder containing HMM profiles created for the purposes of this analysis 

bash-scripts:
	A folder containing bash scripts used in HMMsearching, getting protein sequences based on PROKKA IDs, aligning protein sequences with MAFFT, trimming alignments, and building phylogenetic trees

R-scripts:
	A folder containing R scripts used for creating and cleaning Excel sheets containing MAG, metagenome, nutrient, oxygen, and gene information, performing Pearson correlations, and creating visualizations

protein-alignments:
	A folder containing alignments for curated hits from ODZ MAGs, aligned using MAFFT
